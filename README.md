Hi, I'm Schalk van Dyk. 

FREE SERVICE: 
I'm a full stack web developer from Modimolle, Limpopo, South Africa. I am looking for opportunities to polish my web design and development skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As such I offer a - ---FREE WEB DESIGN AND WEB DEVELOPMENT SERVICE--- All ask in return is for a favorable reference letter, and permission to link my Portfolio Page to your website to display my skills to any potential client. 

ABOUT ME: 
I enjoy both front-end and back-end web development. My passion is to solve problems and implement solutions that is meaningful and creative! I enjoy engaging clients for constructive feedback to solve problems and finding solutions together. 

Web pages shouldn't be boring, but rather be dynamic, responsive, fast and intuitive. The result should be smashing as it reflects on my skills and the service I offer.

Functionality impacts on the user experience and is one of the many important aspects a website should focus on in order for the user to enjoy the journey! Design and development walks hand in hand. I like to develop what users see in their browser or application as it gives me an opportunity to be creative. I also enjoy using logic to serve up sites and applications which render a great user interface and experience! I focus on responsive design and maintainable code that scales easily, and improves web performance! 

The server side of an application, how it works and everything that communicates between the database and the browser is what interests me most. Careful planning and proper application of back-end technologies will most definitely improve the over-all experience. I like to get my head under the hood to boost engine performance for a smooth ride and don't mind getting my hands dirty. Web pages should load fast, with lag-free interaction. It should also be responsive in respect of any device's view port, with mobile first in mind! Easy to use user interfaces and better experiences allow the user to focus on your product or service!
